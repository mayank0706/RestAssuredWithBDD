RestAssured-BDD-Cucumber-Framework:
This repository demonstrates a robust API automation testing framework using RestAssured, Cucumber, and JUnit/TestNG. The framework follows the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach, making API test cases more readable, maintainable, and collaborative.

Overview:
This framework is designed to test RESTful APIs by combining:
- RestAssured for API Interaction
- Cucumber for writing test scenario in Gherkin
- JUnit as the Test Runner
- Maven for dependency management and build automation

Tech Stack:
- Java 11+
- Maven
- RestAssured
- Cucumber
- JUnit
- Jackson for JSON parsing

Best Practices
- Keep feature files readable and business-oriented
- Reuse step definitions where possible
- Separate API payloads and endpoints into reusable components
- Use environment configurations via property files or profiles
